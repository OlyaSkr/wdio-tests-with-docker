      "For most customers, an annual agreement refers to a commitment to spend a specified amount every month for the next year. Our business-level support plans are also considered an annual agreement. Finally, when you procure a short code, in addition to a one-time fee, you also must agree to either a committed spend package or a business-level support plan.",
      "Our committed spend packages include guided implementation, premium support options, and customized rates.",
      "No worries! Plivo services are available on a monthly subscription basis. Our comprehensive documentation is a great way to familiarize with the offerings. You can request a trial account here and upgrade to use the platform.",
      "Purchase of a short code has a $1,500 one-time fee charged at the time of purchase, and requires a committed spend package or a business-level support plan for purchase.",
      "Plivo is required to comply with local laws for telecommunication services around the globe. To ensure compliance with such regulations globally, we perform a risk assessment on all signups from new potential customers. If our assessment indicates a high risk, we may put a business on a hold list, indicating that we are unable to provide service to them at this time."
